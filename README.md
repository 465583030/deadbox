# Private Agent
Access data and devices in your private network without Dynamic DNS, port opening etc.

**Note:** This is a _concept_, still without implementation!

## Idea

When a user wants to access his private data from the internet, he currently has two possibilities:
* Either he uses a public cloud, like Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive etc., which forces him to _always_ store his data on foreign servers.
* Or he runs a private cloud like ownCloud, Nextcloud or proprietary software found on NAS devices, and allows to access them from the internet.
  This induces a severe security risk, as using security holes would allow an attacker to enter the users private network and data.
  The risk of such a security hole is high, as Dynamic DNS and private clouds rely on a broad interface and many different technologies.
  
It would be better, if the user wouldn't need to neither store his data on foreign servers, nor open his private network to the public internet.
